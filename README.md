## Implementation Guide

### Specific Dietary Tag
To apply a specific dietary tag, such as Pescatarian, use the following JSON structure:
```json
"item_condition": {
    "type": "origins:ingredient",
    "ingredient": {
        "tag": "origins:pescatarian"
    }
}
```
This setup ensures that the Origin can utilize only items tagged as Pescatarian.

### General Meat Category
For Origins designed to consume any type of meat, the simplified `origins:meat` tag can be utilized:
```json
"item_condition": {
    "type": "origins:meat"
}
```
This configuration allows the Origin to use any item classified under the expanded Meat category.

### Organic Tag
The `organic` tag has been broadly defined to encompass all possible items from supported mods plus vanilla foods, aligning with the literal definition of "organic" in a non-chemical context in Minecraft.
